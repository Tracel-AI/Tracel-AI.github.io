  description:
    'Crafting high-performance GPU kernels for common deep learning operations, such as matrix multiplication (matmul) and reduction, requires finesse. The speed of these kernels varies depending on input shapes and the GPU device in use, meaning the fastest one may change based on the context. In Burn, Autotune automates the task of dynamically performing kernel selection, allowing one to create a plethora of kernel variations with confidence that the best-performing one will be executed in every situation.',
